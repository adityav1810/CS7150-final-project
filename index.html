<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>

  This team doesnt have well known names in it, However they are highly motivated researchers working at Google interested in applying deep learning techniques to vision related tasks. 
  Some members are now at different research groups but have collaborated together frequently in the past. 
  Another major research they conducted was "Scaling Vision Transformers to 22 billion parameters". 
  Most of the researches in this study work on scaling deep networks for vision tasks. <br>
